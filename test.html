  <h1>I am an H1 tag. I am the biggest pure tag (no CSS), and I help with S.E.O. (search engine omptimization).</h1>
  <h2>I am an H2 tag. Notice how we are on a new "line"? that's because structure tags (H1, p, div, etc.) are inheritely full-width.</h2>
  <h6>I am an H6 tag. I am the smallest pure structural text tag.</h6>
  <p>I am a p tag. I am VERY useful for all the normal text and even for fun CSS tricks.</p>
  <div>
    <p>I am another p tag inside a div block (<code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>). div tags are like p tags in structure, but they don't have any text styling, and are intended to hold other tags instead of text.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <p>You can't see it, but there's a br tag above me. It's short for break, as in linebreak. This is a fancy tag called a self-closing tag. Self-closing tags are for tags that don't hold anything. They are writen like this: &lt;br /&gt;</p>
  <hr />
  <p>And above me is an hr tag. It's the same as a br tag, but it has a line divider in it.</p>
  <code>I am a code tag. Because I am purely for style, I'm only as wide as I need to be, so I need to put a br tag after me to make the next tag on the next line.</code>

  <p>There are even <sub>sub text</sub> (sub), <sup>super text</sup> (sup), <b>bold</b> (b), <i>italics</i> (i), and <s>striketrough</s> (s) tags for text styling.</p>
