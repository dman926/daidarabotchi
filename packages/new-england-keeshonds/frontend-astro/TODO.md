    - Vertical stack of horizontal scrollers.
    - Store each photo book in storage as folders in /gallery.

    - Render thumbnails with fuzzy load (if I can easily), and smooth expand and transition to original when clicked.

    - Maybe a floating menu for a table of contents?
      - Menu is expanded by default.
      - Close button is floating just outside of the menu. Very clear.
      - Allow a tap on non-clickable elements to trigger the menu visibility toggle.
