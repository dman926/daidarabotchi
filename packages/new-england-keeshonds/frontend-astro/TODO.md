    - Capture emitted event from Eventarc when thumbnail is done processing.
    - Render thumbnails with fuzzy load and smooth expand and transition to original when clicked.
      - Images are being resized to 256x256 and 800x800 in jpeg and avif (includes original image)
      - Fuzzy load all 256x256 images first, then move on to 800x800 (no fuzzy anymore)
      - When clicked, expand 800x800 to full size and show quality toggle that loads original image
  - Same-page navigation
    - Maybe a floating menu for a table of contents?
      - Menu is expanded by default.
      - Close button is floating just outside of the menu. Very clear.
      - Allow a tap on non-clickable elements to trigger the menu visibility toggle.
