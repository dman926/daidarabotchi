# nx-python

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Building

Run `nx build nx-python` to build the library.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test nx-python` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

## TODO

- Fix e2e testing
- Add e2e application generation for application/lib (if i can figure out how to link them properly)
- Figure out how to link python applications to python libraries
  - It's probably best and easiest to build and install the lib locally. This way autocompletion is available and doesn't require any weird os/sys hacking
